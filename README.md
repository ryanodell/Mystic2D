# Mystic2D
Yet another attempt to make a 2D engine using OpenGL - I have a bad case of restart-itus


Important: I am not sure how to do precompiled headers "properly". To save on build times run this once or if any files from the pch have changed
g++ -std=c++11 src/pch.h -H
Note: This is optional, but highly recommended
