# Mystic2D
Yet another attempt to make a 2D engine using OpenGL - I have a bad case of restart-itus

VSCode Settings for reference:
C_Cpp.clang_format_fallbackStyle = {BasedOnStyle: Google, IndentWidth: 4, ColumnLimit: 0}

# Notes for self on what's next:
    - Implement a geniune camera
    - Implement text rendering
    - Implement an ECS of sorts
    - Create an event system
    - Start outfitting "core" as a static library
    - Create REAL precompiled headers - pch is NOT a precompiled header, it was a failed idea...
    - Create a "common" header file
    - Implement lightweight logger
